# Challenge from Holajuniors.com

By chance i saw a video of a youtuberwho promised to start uploading html and css challenges. I decided to start making them just to practice.

This is the first challenge that i do and it corresponds to the easy option of challenge 1 although i will soon do version B which is a little more complex.
